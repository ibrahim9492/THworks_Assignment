## Task Tracker with Smart Insights

This is the **frontend client** application for the THWORKS system ‚Äî a productivity/tracking web-app which helps users 

manage tasks, habits, priorities and view insights.  

The app is a Single-Page Application (SPA) using React and modern CSS, designed for clean UI and efficient state management.

The frontend interacts with a backend API (for example at `http://localhost:3000/api`) which handles user authentication task/habit management and insights.
